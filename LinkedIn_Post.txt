🚀 AI Text Summarizer: Production-Ready LLM Engineering 🤖📜

I've built a full-stack platform that solves the common "context window" limitation in Seq2Seq models. Handing long documents to an LLM often results in truncation—my solution implements a "Dynamic Chunking & Overlap" pipeline to ensure 100% context retention.

Technical Highlights:
🧠 Fine-Tuned NLP Core: Custom Seq2Seq model via PyTorch & Hugging Face for high-fidelity abstractive summaries.
⚡ Dynamic Pipeline: Intelligent token-aware chunking with contextual overlap + recursive summarization for a unified final output.
🔒 Secure API: High-performance FastAPI backend with JWT Bearer authentication and Bcrypt hashing.
🎨 Modern UI/UX: "Cyber" interface (HTML5/CSS3/JS) with glassmorphism, real-time counters, and micro-animations.
📁 DevOps & Security: Proprietary licensing and optimized GitHub environment.

This project covers the full lifecycle of an AI product—from raw data training to a polished, secure web interface.
